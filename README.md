#Fraud Detection in Banking

##  Project Overview

Fraudulent transactions are a major concern in the banking sector, leading to significant financial losses and security risks. This project aims to build a **machine learning-based fraud detection system** that identifies suspicious transactions in real-time.

The model is trained on historical transaction data and uses **statistical analysis, feature engineering, and classification algorithms** to detect anomalies that indicate fraud.

---

##  Objectives

* Detect fraudulent banking transactions with high accuracy.
* Reduce false positives while ensuring genuine transactions remain unaffected.
* Provide insights into the transaction patterns that lead to fraud.

---

##  Dataset

* The dataset contains anonymized **banking transaction records**.
* Features include transaction details such as amount, time, type, and other anonymized variables.
* Target variable:

  * `0` â†’ Legitimate Transaction
  * `1` â†’ Fraudulent Transaction

*(Replace with your actual dataset name and description if needed)*

##  Tech Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries & Tools:**

  * Pandas, NumPy â€“ Data preprocessing
  * Matplotlib, Seaborn â€“ Data visualization
  * Scikit-learn â€“ Machine learning models
  * XGBoost / Random Forest / Logistic Regression â€“ Classification algorithms

---

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Distribution of fraudulent vs non-fraudulent transactions
* Correlation between features
* Data imbalance handling (SMOTE / undersampling / oversampling)

---

##  Machine Learning Models

Implemented and compared multiple models:

* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest Classifier
